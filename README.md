# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Resnet

* Plant disease detection using ResNet is a machine learning (ML) technique that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called ResNet to identify plant diseases from images.

* ResNet is a CNN architecture that uses residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur in deep neural networks.

* To train a ResNet model for plant disease detection, a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plants is required.

* The dataset is preprocessed by resizing the images to a consistent size and normalizing the pixel values.

* During training, the ResNet model is fed batches of images, and the weights of the model are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted class and the true class.

* Plant disease detection using ResNet can help farmers detect diseases early, allowing them to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the disease and improve crop yields.

* The use of ML techniques such as ResNet for plant disease detection has the potential to reduce the use of pesticides, leading to more sustainable agriculture practices.
